# Welcome To Pointers

## What is a Pointer?
    *Pointer* 
        - a pointer is a variable that stores the memory addreses of another variable
        - allows you to directly access and manipulate variables
    *Key Concepts*
        - to declare a pointer, we use an `*`.
        ```c
        int *p // this is a pointer to an intiger
        ```

### Pointer 
    - A pointer is the memory address of a byte
    - each pointer variable holds a single memory address
    - need to show how many bytes is associated with the data
### Memory Adresses
    - A pointer hold the memory address of a variablee, using `&a` you get the address of a
        - `&` means the "address" place holder sort of thing
### Passing Addresses
    - passing a variable directly to a function, its passed by a value, changes inside doesnt affect the original pointer
